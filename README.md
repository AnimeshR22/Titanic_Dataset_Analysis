# Titanic_Dataset_Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis to explore the famous Titanic database. The Titanic set is a popular database in data science and machine learning that contains information about passengers on board the Titanic, including age, gender, class, and survivorship status.

data set
The Titanic dataset used in this analysis is contained in the file titanic.csv, which contains the following variables:

PassengerId - A unique ID for each passenger

Survived - did the passenger survive (0 = no, 1 = yes)

Pclass - engineer class (1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3)

Name - Engineer's name

Gender is the nurse's gender

Age - the age of an engineer

SibSp - Number of siblings/spouses on the Titanic

Piece - The number of parents/children on the Titanic

Ticket - Ticket number

Price - speed engineer

Cabin - cabin number

Port - Port (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

The analysis was performed using the Python programming language and the following libraries:
Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn

Analysis includes:
Data cleaning and processing
Exploratory data analysis to understand the data
Visualize data using various charts and graphs
To run the analysis, you can clone this Repository and run the titanic_analysis.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. The notebook contains step-by-step instructions for data cleaning and research data analysis.

The results:
Analysis of the Titanic database provides important information about the passengers on board the Titanic, their demographics, and their survival status. The analysis shows that factors such as age, gender, and class play an important role in determining the level of passenger safety. This analysis can be extended to explore other aspects of the database and create a more accurate model for predicting passenger safety.
